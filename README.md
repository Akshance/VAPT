# VAPT
A lightweight, non-exploit scanner that runs an Nmap service/version scan, parses results, and creates CSV and HTML reports.

Usage:

  sudo apt install nmap
  
  pip install pandas beautifulsoup4
  
  python vapt_scanner.py <target-ip-or-hostname>

Only run against systems you own or have explicit permission to test.
